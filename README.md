# Valkr
---
A merit based search engine with public algorithms built using Next.js, Vercel, and Postgres on Neon.com with Prisma ORM. This project is presently open sourced but privately owned and operated. Meaning, the project itself is owned by the project maintainer, however, the code for the project is provided to the public and pull requests and participation are encouraged. With that said, it is very early in this projects's lifecycle and we are working very hard to get out our minimum viable product before we begin considering PR's from outside contributors. We appreciate your patience in this matter.
