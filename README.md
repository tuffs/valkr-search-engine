# Valkr

---

A merit based search engine with public algorithms built using Next.js, Vercel, and Postgres on Neon.com with Prisma ORM. This project is presently open sourced but privately owned and operated. Meaning, the project itself is owned by the project maintainer, however, the code for the project is provided to the public and pull requests and participation are encouraged. With that said, it is very early in this projects's lifecycle and we are working very hard to get out our minimum viable product before we begin considering PR's from outside contributors. We appreciate your patience in this matter.

We will use the following LLM to supplement the search engine results until the time comes where we have enough data and resources in our own databases to branch out 100% on our own. The data which is returned from queries that occurr on the LLM as resutls will be added to our database. Then, we will find a way to iterate on our data by user choice and other metrics which curry out unpopular results and bad results in order to provide the best results as additional links to data are aggregated.

This will allow us to begin our project, gather data, and make the search engine useful all at the same time. We will begin to provide metrics on data that is brought in and data which is saved, sorted, culled, and iterated over- as well as HOW that data is manipulated (purely mathematical and statistically important data will win out). We will update uses for each link as it is clicked, allow a review score on link vs search query and more factors. This is being worked out at present and
implementation for the quickest MVP will be given precedence at first.

We need a solid set of statistics which will become important to this project and how the data that this project includes is ranked. This entire process will be done with the goal of providing 100% transparency to our userbase. The desire for this project to grow is very important and at first, the manual submission of links and websites will take presedence in matching results for queries requesting the same data.
